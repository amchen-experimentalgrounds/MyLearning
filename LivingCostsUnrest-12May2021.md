# Civil Unrest?

Food prices are going up.

Oil prices are going up.

Gas stations in the USA are running dry because of a cyber attack.

# The cause of the Arab Spring

It reminds me of research I read about the cause of the Arab Spring. If you don't remember, between 2008-2011, there was widespread civil unrest in the Arab World. Why did this occur? Research by Yaneer Bar-Yam at the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) found two primary causes.

1. A policy of diverting corn for the purpose of fuel production. Ethanol was produced from corn, and then added to gasoline.
2. Financialisation of commodities markets. Speculation drives up food prices, which disproportionately hurts developing coutries.

It makes sense to think that increased living costs would lead to more poverty and civil unrest.

# What's going on now?

When COVID-19 hit, supply chains were severely disrupted. Oil consumption dropped severely, which led to the negative oil futures prices in March of 2021. This was because, althought oil is obviously a resource with value, the people holding the ocntracts were traders who had no intent on actually receiving the barrels, and had no ability to store the barrels. They can't dump the barrels, but they also couldn't find buyers to take the shipment, so the price got lower and lower, until it became negative. There were even barrels of oil stored on idle ships floating in open seas. Food supply was also volatile, because of the floods in China, supply chain disruptions (restaurants closed, hard to sell bulk ingredints). Eg, wheat can be explosive, so it is not easy to quickly adapt a supply chain.

And so, the prices are going up. I hope this is only a temporary thing, and living costs can become more affordable as soon as possible, but if this doesn't happen, then I fear that we could see increasing civil unrest in the coming months/years.
