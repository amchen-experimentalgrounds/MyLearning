# History of science: airborne vs droplet transmission.

I want to share with you some takeaways from a Twitter thread that I read yesterday.

Original thread by a professor of chemistry, Jose-Luis Jimenez: https://twitter.com/jljcolorado/status/1391111720526024708

## Summary
The World Health Organisation (and many other public health authorities) has been very slow to accept the role of airborne transmission in the spread of COVID-19. This is **despite** some of the great research produced by researchers in aerosol science. Professor Jimenez goes over the history of these theories, from miasma theory (the idea that diseases are caused by bad air, which by the way, has some element of truth to it), to person-to-person transmission ("contagionists"), to the time when Floerence Nightingale greatly reduced infection rates with social distancing & ventilation. Professor Jimenez explains that many times in history, authorities have been wrong about disease tramission. But that's not all - authorities have even dismissed outsiders who have proposed alternative theories. 

As an example, John Snow (expert in gases) challenged the idea that Cholera was transmitted by a "miasma", because he saw that the spatial distribution of death was highly clustered by neighbourhood and block, and not diminishing according to some inverse square law. This idea was very unpopular, because others would then have to admit that they were wrong - after they pushed for the construction of sewers which made the problem worse.

## My Takeaways
I don't want this to be an attack on science or the good scientists which have produced crucial work for the benefit of the public. 

I think that while it's important to listen more to a consensus and to not be blindly contrarian, at the same time we have to always look at alternative perspectives and engage with them honestly and digilently.  True science is not an authority. It is a process of discovering information, and a very good one at that. And it relies on us having the courage to defend, and the humility to accept the shortcomings of our ideas.


This is an on-going theme in science and research, that is hard to see from the public's perspective. Science is very hard, and 

It's hard for me to evaluate the research on the transmission of COVID-19, given that I'm not formally trained in these areas. I have seen some convincing case studies which confirm (in my mind) that aerosol transmission is possible, and I've seen reserach claiming that aerosol transmission does lead to more serious illness than other modes of transmission.

That's not the main takeaway from the thread though. The point is that science is very difficult, and no matter what people try to say "the science is settled", "listen to the science", I believe that the science is never settled. There are too many egos, too many 

Why this resistance? Why are changes not loudly anounc
